OK, so, I keep forgetting where exactly I need to add new source files, or remove old ones that aren't in use anymore, so here they are:

- Visual Studio filters
- Makefile object definition, and header definition
- Code::Blocks project file

Remember to actually delete source files that have been removed from projects.
